<p>The episode season number.</p>
<p>If an episode is within a season use this tag.</p>
<p>Where <code>season</code> is a non-zero integer (1, 2, 3, etc.) representing your season number.</p>
<p>To allow the season feature for shows containing a single season, if only one season exists in the RSS feed, Apple&nbsp;Podcasts doesnâ€™t display a season number. When you add a second season to the RSS feed, Apple&nbsp;Podcasts displays the
  season numbers.</p>
