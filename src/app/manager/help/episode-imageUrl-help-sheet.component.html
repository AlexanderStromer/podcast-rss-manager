<p>The episode artwork.</p>
<p>You should use this tag when you have a high quality, episode-specific image you would like listeners to see.</p>
<p>Specify your episode artwork using the <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>&nbsp;attribute in the <code>&lt;itunes:image&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>Depending on their device, listeners see your episode artwork in varying sizes. Therefore, make sure your design is effective at both its original size and at thumbnail size. You should include a title, brand, or source name as part of your
  episode artwork. To avoid technical issues when you update your episode artwork, be sure to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Change the artwork file name and URL at the same time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify the web server hosting your artwork allows HTTP head&nbsp;requests</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Artwork must be a minimum size of 1400&nbsp;x&nbsp;1400 pixels and a maximum size of 3000 x 3000 pixels, in JPEG or PNG format, 72 dpi, with appropriate file extensions (.jpg, .png), and in the RGB colorspace. These requirements are different
  from the standard RSS image tag specifications.</p>
<p>Make sure the file type in the URL matches the actual file type of the image file.</p>
