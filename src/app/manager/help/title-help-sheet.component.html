<p>The show title.</p>
<p>
  Itâ€™s important to have a clear, concise name for your podcast. Make your title
  specific. A show titled <em>Our Community Bulletin</em> is too vague to
  attract many subscribers, no matter how compelling the content.

<p>
  Pay close attention to the title as Apple&nbsp;Podcasts uses this field for
  search.
</p>
<p>
  If you include a long list of keywords in an attempt to game podcast search,
  your show may be removed from the Apple directory.
