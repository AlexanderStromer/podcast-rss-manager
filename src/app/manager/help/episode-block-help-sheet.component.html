<p>The episode show or hide status.</p>
<p>If you want an episode removed from the Apple directory, use this tag.</p>
<p>Specifying the <code>&lt;itunes:block&gt;</code> tag with a <code>Yes</code> value prevents that episode from appearing in Apple&nbsp;Podcasts.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to block a specific episode if you know that its content would otherwise cause the entire podcast to be removed from Apple&nbsp;Podcasts.</p>
<p>Specifying any value other than <code>Yes</code> has no effect.</p>
