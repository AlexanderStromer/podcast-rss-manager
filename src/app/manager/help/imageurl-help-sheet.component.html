  Depending on their device, subscribers see your podcast artwork in varying
  sizes. Therefore, make sure your design is effective at both its original size
  and at thumbnail size. You should include a show title, brand, or source name
  as part of your podcast artwork. Here are additional

  >. For examples of podcast artwork, see the Top Podcasts chart. To avoid
  technical issues when you update your podcast artwork, be sure to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Change the artwork file name and URL at the same time</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Verify the web server hosting your artwork allows HTTP head&nbsp;requests
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Artwork must be a minimum size of 1400&nbsp;x&nbsp;1400 pixels and a maximum
  size of 3000 x 3000 pixels, in JPEG or PNG format, 72 dpi, with appropriate
  file extensions (.jpg, .png), and in the RGB colorspace. These requirements
  are different from the standard RSS image tag specifications.
</p>
<p>
  Make sure the file type in the URL matches the actual file type of the image
  file.
