# Podcast RSS Manager

Angular-built tool, which allows for Podcast RSS feed manipulation. The resulting file can be directly used as feed file for Apple Podcast or other broadcasters.
As with all podcasts, the audio-files need to be hosted on a decent cloudserver (AWS S3 or similar)
The intention for this tool was to provide a cost-effective way for a podcaster to manage a feed in an easy way (similar to the rather expensive Podcast-services)

App runs here and ready to use (no data will be stored): https://alexanderstromer.github.io/podcast-rss-manager/

Enjoy!
